                 Hello!
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Yesterday, we went at Octant Pizza(recently opened near<br>
                 Commerce 6-way) for dinner. It was<br>
                 amazing and the food was also delicious.<br>
                 All types of foods were there- South Indian like dosas and chutneys, Barbeque e.g. Paneer Tikka, Italian like our all-time-favourite pizzas etc.,<br>
                 and there was also cooked potato with chapati.</p>
                    <span id= "dots">...</span><br>
                 <div id= "more">
                     <p>
                         The Margherita Pizza was the best there. If I compare 'Under The Neem Trees'<br>
                         with it, obviously, Octant Pizza would be better of the two. In short, it's not a <br>
                         'raste ka maal saste me' and was really fantastic. But when<br>
                         compared with La Milano's, both would be equal. I'll give it a 5-star rating...🡪
